This is a sample text that I used to test the summarization pipeline. It contains several sentences so the chunker and summarizer behavior can be observed.

The goal of this text is just to create some content. It is not meaningful in depth but helps to test the edge cases of splitting and merging summaries.

Final paragraph to ensure we have extra content. This helps to show multi-chunk processing.
